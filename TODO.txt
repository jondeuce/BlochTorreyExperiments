VISUALISATION
- Plotter for complex magnetizations!

PROPAGATION
- Instead of summing 512^3 matrix to get complex signal, take take k=0 term
  in k-space
- Along the same lines, instead of keeping only the total complex signal,
  include some other components of kspace in the iFFT; this allows one to
  to save a low-resolution, spatially averaged signal with an accurate
  total complex signal
    - May not really be possible (or would much slower time-wise, at least)
      using VTV propagation methods

GEOMETRY
- Periodic minor cylinders!
